# KaibaReduxClient

This is part of my senior project at Cal Poly Pomona. The project is a proposed website redesign for the Kaiba Japanese Restaurant. This project will be to create a fully functional dynamic restaurant online menu. It will consist of a web-based API that can return JSON containing menu information. The client side will use javascript ajax calls to query the API for the JSON.

This is client portion of the Kaiba Redux Project. It uses the ASP.net framework.
